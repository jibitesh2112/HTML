 <h1 style="margin-top: 10px;">HTML</h1> 
<img src="HTML_logo.png">
<br>
 <p class="abc">HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML documents are written using HTML tags embedded in angular brackets. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has defined the HTML tags.
</p>
<h2>Brief History of HTML</h2>
<p class="abc">In the late 1980's, a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.

Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.</p>

<h2>HTML Versions</h2>
    <img src="HTML Versions.png">
    <br>
    <br><br>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the HTML version is given below:</p>
<ol style="font-size: 17px;">
    <p><li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>HTML 1.0:</u></b> The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was released in 1991.</p></li>

<p><li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>HTML 2.0:</u></b> This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option button, etc.</p></li>

<p><li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>HTML 3.2:</u></b> HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the browsers.</p></li>

<p><li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>HTML 4.01:</u></b> HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language. This version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various multimedia elements.</p></li>

<p><li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>HTML 5:</u></b> HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced in January 2008. Two major organizations- W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) are involved in the development of HTML 5 version which is still under development.</p></li></ol>
<h2>Applications of HTML</h2>
<p class="abc">HTML has been used widely and effectively. Some of the common applications of HTML are as follows:</p>
<ol class="abc">
<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Web pages development</u></b></li>
<p>HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web. Every page contains a set of HTML tags, including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages. Every page that we witness on the world wide web is written using a version of HTML code.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Web document Creation</u></b></li>
<p>Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM, i.e. document object model. HTML tags are inserted before and afterwards or phrases to locate their format and location on the page. A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body. Head includes the information to identify the document, including title and any other important keyword. A title can be seen on the browser’s bar, and the body section is the main portion of the website visible to the viewer. All three segments are designed and created by the uses of HTML tags. Every section has its own specific set of tags, which are dedicatedly rendered, keeping the head, title and body concepts in a loop.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Internet navigation</u></b></li>
<p>This is one of the most important uses of HTML, which is revolutionary. This navigation is possible by utilizing the concept of Hypertext. It is basically a text which refers to other web pages or text, and when the user clicks on it, would navigate to referenced text or page. HTML is heavily used to embed the hyperlink within the web pages. A user can easily navigate the web pages and between websites as well, located on different servers.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Cutting edge feature</u></b></li>
<p>HTML5, with its set of standards and API, is being used to introduce some of the latest trends in the website creation business. Like polyfill libraries, which are supported by old browsers equally well. Browser like Google Chrome is the perfect choice when it comes to implementing an HTML5 latest set of standards and APIs. A JavaScript library is available called Modernizr, which can detect features that let the developer dynamically load polyfill libraries as required.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Responsive images on web pages</u></b></li>
<p>At the elementary level in applications of HTML, queries can be set to utilize the images, which are responsive in nature. With the srcset attribute of img element in HTML and combining it with picture elements, a developer can fully control how the user will render an image. Now different types of an image with size variation can be loaded by using the img element. Rules can be easily set with the picture element; we can declare the img element with the default source, and then for every case, a source can be provided.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Client-side storage</u></b></li>
<p>Earlier, a user could not save the user’s browser data that would persist across sessions. To meet this requirement, server-side infrastructure has to be built, or user’s cookies can be used. But with HTML5, client-side storage is feasible using localStorage and IndexDB. These two strategies have their own standards and features. localStorage basically gives string-based hash-table storage. Its API is very simple and provides the developer with setItem, getItem, and removeItem methods. IndexDB, on the other hand, is a larger and better client-side data store. IndexDB database can be expanded with the user’s permission.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Offline capabilities usage</u></b></li>
<p>Once data can be stored in the browser, the developer can think of a strategy to make the application work when a user is disconnected. HTML5 has its application cache mechanism, which would define how the browser manages the offline situation. Application cache, responsible for offline ability, comprises different components, including API methods that create an update, read manifest file, and events. By using the certain property in HTML5, a developer can check if the application is online or not. A developer can also specify in the website’s application cache manifest file the information, like what browser manages resources for offline use. In the manifest file, resources that are available offline can also be specified.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Data Entry support with HTML</u></b></li>
<p>HTML5 standard and set of APIs can be used to support data entry level of work. As browsers implement new HTML5 standards, developers can simply add the tags to the tag, indicating required fields, text, data format, etc. HTML5 has come up with several new attributes to drive on-screen keyboards, validation, and other data-entry experiences so that end-user can have a better data entry.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Game development usage</u></b></li>
<p>Before the advent of HTML5, game development was an exclusive domain of Flash and Silverlight. Since browsers support new specifications for HTML5, including CSS3 and light-fast JavaScript engine to drive a new rich experience, HTML5 can bring the reality of game development possible, which was earlier the forte of Flash and Silverlight. Every feature of APIs needs not to be implemented, but the most appropriate ones can be utilized while eliminating the rest of the features.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Native APIs usage to enrich a website</u></b></li>
<p>HTML5 adds so many new abilities and tools, which was just an imagination in the past. A large set of new APIs regarding file system, Geolocation, drag and drop, event handling, client-storage etc., are the capabilities that make usage of HTML5 more easier than ever before. Application experience can be enhanced with other APIs like Fullscreen, Visibility and Media Capture. A modern web application has asynchronous nature, which can be fostered using Websockets and Web workers like APIs.</p>
</ol>

<h2>HTML as a Markup Language</h2>
<p class="abc">HTML is a type of markup language. It encapsulates, or “marks up” data within HTML tags, which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage. The web browser then reads the HTML, which tells it things like which parts are headings, which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc. The HTML describes the data to the browser, and the browser then displays the data accordingly.</p>

<h2>HTML is not a Programming Language</h2>
<p class="abc">Programming languages have functional purposes. HTML, as a markup language doesn’t really “do” anything in the sense that a programming language does. HTML contains no programming logic. It doesn’t have common conditional statements such as If/Else. It can’t evaluate expressions or do any math. It doesn’t handle events or carry out tasks. You can’t declare variables and you can’t write functions. It doesn’t modify or manipulate data in any way. HTML can’t take input and produce output. Think of it this way: you can’t compute the sum of 2 + 2 in HTML; that’s not what it’s for. This is because HTML is not a programming language.</p>

<h2>Types of Editors used for writing HTML code</h2>
<br>
<ol class="abc" type="1">
<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>Textual HTML Editor</u></b></li>
<p>These are text-based editors where the developers can write their codes and compile them. The code appears in the same manner we write it, thus it requires basic knowledge of HTML. Some of these editors also provide features of making a project, managing all the files related to the web, etc. Examples of HTML Text editors include-Notepad++, VSCode,Sublime Text.</p>

<li><b style="color:rgb(7, 39, 53)"><u>WYSIWYG HTML Editor</u></b></li>
<p>’What you see is what you get’ is its full form. WYSIWYG are editors that provide the preview of the output of the source code i.e. as it would appear on a browser. There is a drag and drop feature available in most of them that eases the handling. It does not require any hardcore knowledge of HTML, thus enabling non-technicals to easily develop websites. Examples include-Adobe Dreamweaver, Amaya, BlueGriffon, etc.</p>

<p class="abc">HTML can be written in simple text editors such as Notepad or TextEdit, but other widely used editors are:</p>

<div  class="abc" class="container-fluid">
